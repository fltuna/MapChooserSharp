### Abundant Customization Options

See [ConVar Document](docs/en/configuration/CONVAR.md) for ConVar configuration

See [Map Config Document](docs/en/configuration/MAP_CONFIG.md) for Map configuration

See [Plugin Config Document](docs/en/configuration/PLUGIN_CONFIG.md) for Plugin configuration

### Automatic Detection of Map Time Type

It checks three CVars: `mp_timelimit`, `mp_maxrounds`, and `mp_roundtime`, and automatically selects the most appropriate one.

The check order is `mp_maxrounds` -> `mp_timelimit` -> `mp_roundtime`. If any of these CVars is non-zero, it will use that CVar as the basis for detecting the map time type.

Also, for `mp_roundtime`-based servers like surf servers, the round time is directly extended when an map extend occurs.

### Powerful API
